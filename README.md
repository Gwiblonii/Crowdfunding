# 🟢 Crowdfunding Smart Contract with Brownie

This project is a crowdfunding smart contract based on Chainlink's [FundMe](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/hardhat-fund-me-fcc), built and deployed using [Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), with unit tests and full functionality deployed on the Sepolia testnet.

## 📌 Project Description

This contract allows users to fund a campaign in ETH. If the campaign reaches its USD goal (using Chainlink Price Feeds) before the deadline, the campaign owner can withdraw the funds. If **the goal is not met**, users can **manually request a refund** of their contributions.
